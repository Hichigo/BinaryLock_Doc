# BP\_LedLock\_4Bit\_Wall

* Lock inherited from **BP\_CoreBinaryLock**.
* Adjusted the number of buttons (4 pieces).
* Added static grid component (**SM\_LedLockPanelLite**). In this grid, there is a LED material for which indicates whether the lock is open or closed (red - closed, green - open). The **SetLedGreenLight** function has also been redefined, in which the logic for changing the LED color to green has been added.
